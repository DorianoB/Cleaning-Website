      <h3 className="cleaningRight">Cleaning Services</h3>
      <p className="cleaningServicesRight">
        With years of industry experience, we've discovered that cleaning holds
        significant potential to achieve the highest standards we offer. In the
        case of short-term rentals, the most challenging aspect is the turnover
        process, where ensuring both owner and guest satisfaction is key to
        providing exceptional service. <br></br>We pride ourselves on offering a
        range of cleaning services, including:
        <ul>
          <li>Airbnb cleaning</li>
          <li>Commercial cleaning</li>
          <li>Residentail cleaning</li>
          <li>Bond cleaning</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        Our wash, dry, and fold service ensures your guests always enjoy fresh,
        clean sheets and towels. We take care of laundering your bedding,
        towels, and other linens, washing, drying, and folding them with care.

      <h3 className="cleaningRight">Restocking Essentials</h3>
      <p className="cleaningServicesRight">
        Small details can greatly enhance your guests' comfort, convenience, and
        overall experience. For instance, we make sure to stock the kitchen
        daily with coffee, tea, and sugar. We also restock essential items such
        as body wash, shampoo, conditioner, hand soap, and toilet paper in the
        bathroom. Additionally, we ensure there is laundry detergent,
        dishwashing liquid, and that the kitchen has fresh sponges, wipes, tea
        towels, and bin liners.
